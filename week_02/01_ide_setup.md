# Week 2 — Part 01: IDE Setup and AI Configuration

## Overview

Your first step is setting up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with AI integration. We recommend Cursor, but VS Code with Copilot is also an option.

If terms like IDE, extension, command-line coding tool, or AI editor are unfamiliar, start with [00_ai_coding_tools_landscape.md](00_ai_coding_tools_landscape.md) before installing anything.

## Why an IDE with AI?

### The difference from browser-based AI

| Browser-based AI (ChatGPT) | IDE with AI (Cursor) |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| You paste code manually | AI reads files directly |
| No project context | AI knows your project |
| Manual file operations | AI can edit files |
| Separate window | Integrated in your workspace |

### What you gain

- **File awareness**: AI sees what you're working on
- **Project context**: AI understands relationships between files
- **Direct editing**: AI can modify code in your files
- **Integrated workflow**: Everything in one place

## Alternative: VS Code + GitHub Copilot

If you prefer VS Code:

## Cursor Interface Tour

### Key areas

| Area | Shortcut | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **File explorer** | Cmd+B | Browse project files |
| **Editor** | — | View and edit files |
| **AI Chat** | Cmd+L | Conversational AI |
| **Terminal** | Cmd+J | Run commands |
| **AI Inline** | Cmd+K | Edit at cursor position |

### Two AI modes

1. **Chat mode** (Cmd+L)
   - Conversation with AI
   - Ask questions about your project
   - Request explanations
   - Plan modifications

2. **Inline mode** (Cmd+K)
   - Select code → press Cmd+K
   - Describe what you want
   - AI edits directly in the file

---

## Essential Shortcuts

| Shortcut (Mac) | Shortcut (Win) | Action |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Cmd+L | Ctrl+L | Open AI chat |
| Cmd+K | Ctrl+K | Inline AI edit |
| Cmd+B | Ctrl+B | Toggle file explorer |
| Cmd+J | Ctrl+J | Toggle terminal |
| Cmd+S | Ctrl+S | Save file |
| Cmd+P | Ctrl+P | Quick file open |

**Practice these**: They're essential for efficient workflow.

## Configuring AI Behavior

### AI model selection

Cursor lets you choose the AI model:

| Model | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Claude Sonnet** | Balanced, good for most tasks |
| **GPT-4** | Strong reasoning, versatile |
| **Cursor-small** | Fast, good for simple tasks |

**Recommendation**: Use Claude Sonnet or GPT-4 for learning.

### AI settings (optional)

You can customize:
- **Context files**: Which files AI should prioritize
- **Response style**: More concise vs more detailed
- **Auto-suggestions**: Enable/disable inline suggestions

**For beginners**: Use default settings first.

---

## Verification: Is it working?

### Test your setup

1. Open Cursor
2. Open the `week_02/code_templates` folder
3. Press Cmd+L to open AI chat
4. Send this prompt:
   ```
   What files are in this folder?
   ```
5. You should receive a response listing the files

If this works, your setup is complete.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Opening wrong folder

**Symptom**: AI doesn't see the files you expect.

**Fix**: Check which folder you opened:
- File explorer shows the folder contents
- If wrong, File → Open Folder → choose correct one

### Pitfall 2: AI chat not opening

**Symptom**: Cmd+L doesn't open chat panel.

**Fix**:
- Check if Cursor is the active window
- Try View → AI Chat from menu
- Restart Cursor if needed

### Pitfall 3: No AI response

**Symptom**: You send a prompt but get no response.

**Fix**:
- Check if you're signed in (required for AI)
- Check your trial status (may have expired)
- Try simpler prompt to test connectivity

### Pitfall 4: Can't find shortcuts

**Symptom**: Shortcuts don't work or you don't know them.

**Fix**:
- View → Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
- Type "AI" to find AI-related commands
- Keyboard shortcuts are shown in menu
