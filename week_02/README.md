# Week 2: AI-Assisted Python Setup, Running Code, and Debugging

## Week Overview

Building on Week 1, students now transition from general AI tool use to AI-assisted Python learning. This week focuses on using AI tools fluently: asking coding questions, setting up a Python environment, running simple code, reading functions, making small edits, and debugging real errors.

Week 2 is guided programming practice, not independent software development. Students are expected to use AI as a tutor while they personally run code and verify results.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Explain the basic landscape of IDEs, AI editor extensions, and command-line AI coding tools
- Install and configure VS Code or Cursor with AI assistant integrations
- Use ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Copilot Chat, or Claude Code-style tutor workflows to learn Python
- Create and activate a Python virtual environment for course work
- Run simple Python scripts and optional Jupyter notebooks
- Navigate basic IDE operations with AI-powered features
- Read and comprehend unfamiliar codebases using AI assistance
- Modify existing code with AI-guided suggestions and refactoring
- Debug common errors efficiently using AI-powered debugging tools

## Prerequisites

- **Week 1 completion**: Students must have completed Week 1 exercises and understand fundamental prompt engineering concepts
- No prior Python experience is required, but students will run guided Python commands in class
- Basic familiarity with command line operations is helpful, but the required commands are introduced in class
- Access to a computer capable of running VS Code or Cursor

## Exercises

All exercises use provided templates found in the `code_templates/` directory. Students will:

1. **AI Python Learning Exercise**: Use Week 1-style prompts to learn Python concepts needed for Week 3.
2. **Environment Setup Exercise**: Create `.venv`, install dependencies, and verify pandas.
3. **Run Code Exercise**: Run template functions from a script or notebook and explain the output.
4. **Code Exploration Exercise**: Use AI to understand a provided codebase and document its functionality.
5. **Code Modification Exercise**: Implement specific changes to existing code with AI guidance.
6. **Debugging Challenge**: Fix one runtime error and one logic error using the isolated scripts in `debugging_exercises/`.
7. **Mixed Debugging Challenge (Optional)**: Try `code_templates/debugging_practice.py` after the isolated exercises.

### Tips for Success

1. **Start with small tasks**: Begin with simple AI requests before tackling complex refactoring
2. **Verify AI suggestions**: Always review and understand AI-generated code before accepting it
3. **Use specific prompts**: Apply Week 1 prompt engineering skills for better AI responses
4. **Practice regularly**: Spend time daily using the IDE with AI to build muscle memory
5. **Keep notes**: Document useful AI interactions and IDE shortcuts for future reference
6. **Ask for explanations**: When AI suggests code changes, ask it to explain why
7. **Maintain code ownership**: Use AI as a tool, not a replacement for understanding your code

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Blindly accepting AI suggestions without understanding them
- Over-relying on AI for simple tasks you should learn to do manually
- Neglecting to test AI-generated code thoroughly
- Forgetting to commit code before making AI-assisted changes
