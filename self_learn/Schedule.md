# 8-Week AI Engineering Course Schedule

## Overview
This schedule organizes the AI Engineering Starter Tutorial into 6 weeks of structured teaching followed by 2 weeks of project work to consolidate all knowledge points.

> Note: this self-learn schedule is an optional 8-week reference path. Its Week 5 and Week 6 topics do not match the current v2.2 6-week classroom course, where Week 5 is ML baselines and Week 6 is the CSV-to-LLM capstone.
