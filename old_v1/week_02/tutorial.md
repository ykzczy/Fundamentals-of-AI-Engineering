# Foundations Course — Week 2 Tutorials

## Pre-study (Self-learn)

Foundations Course assumes Self-learn is complete. If you need a refresher:

- [Pre-study index (Foundations Course → Self-learn)](../PRESTUDY.md)
- [Self-learn — Chapter 2: Python and Environment Management](../self_learn/Chapters/2/Chapter2.md)

## Overview

These tutorials expand Week 2 into a step-by-step, reproducible baseline ML workflow.

## Navigation

- [01 — The ML training loop (split → train → evaluate → save)](01_training_loop.md)
- [02 — Reproducibility package (seeds, configs, artifacts)](02_reproducibility_package.md)
- [03 — Comparing runs + writing a short report](03_compare_runs_report.md)

## Recommended order

1. Read 01 and get a baseline run working.
2. Read 02 and make your artifacts reproducible.
3. Read 03 and practice controlled comparisons.

Exercises are included at the end of each notebook.

Why this order works:

1. **Baseline first**
    - A baseline run proves the whole loop works end-to-end (load → split → train → eval → save).
    - What to verify: you can produce an `artifacts/run_.../metrics.json` and re-run without overwriting.

2. **Reproducibility second**
    - Once it runs, make it repeatable: same command should produce explainably similar results.
    - What to verify: your run saves a config (seed, split settings) and you can point to the exact run that produced a metric.

3. **Comparisons third**
    - Only compare experiments after you’ve controlled variables; otherwise you can’t learn from results.
    - What to verify: you change one thing at a time (e.g., `max_iter`, model type, or one feature).
