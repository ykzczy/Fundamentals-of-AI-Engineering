# Foundations Course — Week 1 Tutorials

## Pre-study (Self-learn)

Foundations Course assumes Self-learn is complete. If you need a refresher:

- [Pre-study index (Foundations Course → Self-learn)](../PRESTUDY.md)
- [Self-learn — Chapter 1: Tool Preparation](../self_learn/Chapters/1/Chapter1.md)
- [Self-learn — Chapter 2: Python and Environment Management](../self_learn/Chapters/2/Chapter2.md)

## Overview

These tutorials expand Week 1 into a step-by-step, chapter-style walkthrough.

## Navigation

- [01 — Environment setup + dependency management](01_environment_setup.md)
- [02 — Data profiling script (CSV -> JSON/Markdown outputs)](02_data_profiling_script.md)

## Recommended order

1. Read 01, set up your environment.
2. Read 02, implement and run the profiling script.

Why this order works:

1. **Environment first**
    - If your environment is unstable, every later step becomes “mystery debugging”.
    - What to verify: you can run `python --version`, activate your venv, and run a small script twice with the same output.

2. **Profiling script second**
    - This is your first “reproducible artifact” workflow: input file → deterministic outputs.
    - What to verify: running the script creates `output/` files in the same place, with predictable names.
    - Example: your script should fail clearly on missing input and succeed on a small sample CSV.
    - Exercises (required-columns check, numeric summaries) are included at the end of the notebook.
