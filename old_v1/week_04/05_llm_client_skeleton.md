# Week 4 — Part 05: A reusable `llm_client.py` skeleton

## Overview

Your goal is a single module you can reuse across projects that provides:

- timeouts
- retries + backoff
- basic rate limit handling
- basic caching
- logging

This is a Foundations Course skeleton (provider-agnostic). You can adapt it to OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.

---

## Pre-study (Self-learn)

Foundations Course assumes Self-learn is complete. If you need a refresher on reliability/operations and debugging practices:

- [Pre-study index (Foundations Course → Self-learn)](../PRESTUDY.md)
- [Self-learn — Chapter 5: Resource Monitoring and Containerization](../self_learn/Chapters/5/Chapter5.md)

Why it matters here (Week 4):

- The client is the reliability boundary: timeouts/retries/logs/caching should be consistent across scripts.
- Centralizing these behaviors prevents “every notebook reinvents reliability differently”.

---

## Skeleton design

We’ll define:

- a request payload (model + prompt + settings)
- a stable cache key
- a `call()` method

The cache key must represent the “effective input” to the model. If two requests differ in any setting that can change output, they must not share a key.

---

## Example code

```python
import hashlib
import json
import logging
import time
from dataclasses import asdict, dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class LLMRequest:
    model: str
    prompt: str
    temperature: float = 0.0


class SimpleMemoryCache:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._store: Dict[str, str] = {}

    def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[str]:
        return self._store.get(key)

    def set(self, key: str, value: str) -> None:
        self._store[key] = value


def make_cache_key(req: LLMRequest) -> str:
    raw = json.dumps(asdict(req), sort_keys=True)
    return hashlib.sha256(raw.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()


class LLMClient:
    def __init__(self, cache: Optional[SimpleMemoryCache] = None) -> None:
        self._cache = cache or SimpleMemoryCache()

    def _provider_call(self, req: LLMRequest, timeout_s: float) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError("Implement provider-specific HTTP/API call")

    def call(self, req: LLMRequest, timeout_s: float = 30.0, max_retries: int = 2) -> str:
        cache_key = make_cache_key(req)
        cached = self._cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached is not None:
            logger.info("llm_cache_hit", extra={"model": req.model})
            return cached

        last_err = None  # type: Optional[Exception]
        for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
            t0 = time.time()
            try:
                text = self._provider_call(req, timeout_s=timeout_s)
                logger.info(
                    "llm_call_ok",
                    extra={"model": req.model, "latency_s": time.time() - t0, "attempt": attempt},
                )
                self._cache.set(cache_key, text)
                return text
            except Exception as e:
                last_err = e
                logger.warning(
                    "llm_call_failed",
                    extra={"model": req.model, "latency_s": time.time() - t0, "attempt": attempt},
                )
                if attempt < max_retries:
                    time.sleep(min(2 ** attempt, 4))

In more robust clients, you often also add jitter to avoid “retry storms” (many clients retrying at the same time). For Foundations Course, the simple backoff is enough.

        raise RuntimeError(f"LLM call failed after retries: {last_err}")
```

---

## Next steps

- Implement `_provider_call()` using your chosen provider SDK.
- Add structured output validation from Week 3.
- Use this client in Week 6 capstone pipeline.

---

## Exercise: Persist raw failures

Goal:

- If the provider call fails (e.g. timeout), persist a short JSON record under `output/`.
- Return the written path.

Checkpoint:

- Trigger a failure and confirm `output/raw_failure.json` exists.
