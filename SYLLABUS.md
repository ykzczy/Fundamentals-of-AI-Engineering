## Course Introduction

AI Engineering Fundamentals is specifically designed for students from non-technical backgrounds, employing an innovative three-stage progressive teaching model: **"Agent Tools Introduction → AI-Assisted Learning → Technical Hands-on Practice."**

The first two weeks require no programming background. Students will first learn to use AI Agent tools such as Cursor, ChatGPT, and Kilo, establishing an intuitive understanding of AI capabilities and developing effective methodologies for working with AI. Starting from Week 3, students will gradually learn core technical skills—including Python programming, local inference, API engineering, data processing, machine learning, and LLM applications—with the assistance of AI tools.

### Core Philosophy

**"Learn AI with AI"** — Make AI an accelerator for learning, not a replacement for understanding.
