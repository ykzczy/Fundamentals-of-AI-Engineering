# Fundamentals of AI Engineering - 6-Week Beginner Program

## Course Overview

The **Fundamentals of AI Engineering** course is designed for AI beginners, including learners with non-technical backgrounds. It follows a progressive model:

**Agent Tools Introduction -> AI-Assisted Python Setup and Code Practice -> Technical Practice -> Capstone Delivery**

The course emphasizes practical confidence, conceptual intuition, AI-assisted learning, and reproducible project delivery. Students first learn how to collaborate with AI tools, then gradually use those tools to understand code, process data, call LLMs, run basic ML experiments, and complete a small end-to-end AI project.

## Target Students

- **Complete Beginners**: Learners with no programming experience who want to enter AI, data analytics, or AI-assisted development.
- **Tool Users**: Professionals already using AI tools who want stronger technical foundations.
- **Technical Learners**: Developers or analysts who want a beginner-friendly path through core AI engineering habits.

## Prerequisites

### Week 1: No Programming Required

- Ability to use a browser and create online accounts.
- Ability to install and open desktop software.
- Basic computer operation skills.

### Week 2: Guided Python With AI Assistance

- No prior Python experience is required.
- Students will run guided Python commands, create a virtual environment, and debug small examples with AI support.
- The focus is fluency with AI learning workflows, not independent programming from scratch.

### Weeks 3-6: Introductory Technical Practice With AI Assistance

- Basic terminal operations will be introduced in class.
- Python concepts are taught through guided examples and AI-assisted practice.
- Self-learn materials are optional refreshers, not required prerequisites.

## Learn AI With AI

The core philosophy is **"Learn AI with AI"**:

1. **Week 1**: Learn to use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Kilo, and GitHub Copilot Chat for general tasks.
2. **Week 2**: Use those AI tools to learn Python, set up an environment, run code, and debug errors.
3. **Weeks 3-6**: Use AI tools to process data, build LLM workflows, run simple experiments, and deliver a capstone.

AI is a learning accelerator, not a replacement for understanding. Students are expected to explain what they submitted, document how AI helped, and verify outputs before trusting them.

## 6-Week Teaching Plan

| Week | Theme | Main Deliverable |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Week 1 | Agent Tools Introduction | AI tool experience report, representative prompts, and reflection |
| Week 2 | AI-Assisted Python Setup + Code Practice | AI Python prompt log, environment check, code run evidence, modifications, and debugging record |
| Week 3 | Data Processing + Reproducible Outputs | CSV data profiling script with `profile.json` and `profile.md` |
| Week 4 | LLM Fundamentals + API Reliability | `profile.json` -> structured insights demo with validation and reliability notes |
| Week 5 | ML Training Loop | Two lightweight baseline runs and a short comparison report |
| Week 6 | Capstone: Intelligent Data Analysis Script | CSV -> `report.json` + `report.md` + short demo |

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. **Use AI agent tools effectively**
   - Select appropriate tools for writing, research, code explanation, and debugging.
   - Document useful prompts and reflect on tool strengths and limits.

2. **Read, modify, and debug code with AI assistance**
   - Explain simple Python functions.
   - Make small changes safely.
   - Use error messages and AI feedback to debug.

3. **Process data reproducibly**
   - Create and verify a clean Python environment before data work.
   - Load and inspect CSV data with pandas.
   - Generate stable JSON and Markdown profiling reports.

4. **Build basic LLM workflows**
   - Explain tokens, context windows, and structured prompts.
   - Request JSON-like outputs and validate them.
   - Add beginner-friendly timeout, retry, and logging practices.
   - Convert a data profile into structured AI-style insights without requiring API access.

5. **Understand the ML training loop**
   - Train a basic baseline model.
   - Save metrics and compare two runs.
   - Explain results without relying on advanced math.

6. **Deliver a small end-to-end AI project**
   - Build a reproducible intelligent data analysis script.
   - Combine data profiling, LLM explanation, and report generation.
   - Demonstrate the project and explain key decisions.
