# Week 6 — Capstone Template Completion Guide

This guide explains how to complete the capstone template without turning it into a copy-paste solution. The project remains an **AI-Assisted CSV Data Analyzer**:

```text
CSV input -> data profiling -> compressed summary -> real LLM interpretation -> report.json + report.md
```

The provided template gives structure, function signatures, TODOs, and expected outputs. You must fill in the implementation.

## What the Template Is

The template is a scaffold:

- It shows the files a small project should have.
- It names the main functions and their input/output contracts.
- It leaves key logic as TODOs.
- It gives prompts you can use with an AI Agent Coding Tool.

The template is **not** a finished project and should not run end-to-end until you complete it.

## What You Must Complete

### Stage 1: Data Profiling

File: `capstone_template/src/data_profile.py`

Complete:

- CSV loading or dataframe handling.
- Row and column counts.
- Column names and data types.
- Missing value counts.
- Duplicate row count.
- Basic numeric summaries.
- Basic categorical summaries.
- Simple anomaly hints.

AI Agent prompt idea:

```text
Help me complete build_profile() for a beginner capstone.
First explain the expected input/output contract, then suggest code.
Do not remove the required top-level keys.
```

### Stage 2: Compression

File: `capstone_template/src/compression.py`

Complete:

- A compact summary for the LLM.
- Deterministic sample rows.
- Selected numeric and categorical summaries.
- Token-budget estimate or note.

Do not send the full CSV to the LLM.

AI Agent prompt idea:

```text
Help me implement compress_profile(profile, df).
The output should be compact enough for an LLM and should not include the full dataset.
Use a fixed random seed for sampling.
```

### Stage 3: Real LLM Interpretation

File: `capstone_template/src/llm_interpretation.py`

Complete:

- Structured prompt assembly.
- Real LLM API call.
- Timeout/retry or repair attempt.
- Raw response saving.
- Basic output validation.

Mock responses may help local debugging, but the final submission must include a successful real LLM run.

AI Agent prompt idea:

```text
Help me add a real LLM call to call_llm().
Keep the response JSON-shaped, save the raw response, and add clear error handling.
Ask me what provider/API style I am using before writing provider-specific code.
```

### Stage 4: Report Building

File: `capstone_template/src/report_builder.py`

Complete:

- `output/report.json` with stable top-level keys.
- `output/report.md` with a readable summary.
- Recommendations and risk notes from the LLM result.
- Errors or warnings surfaced clearly.

AI Agent prompt idea:

```text
Help me complete build_json_report() and build_markdown_report().
Keep the JSON top-level schema stable and make the Markdown readable for a nontechnical reviewer.
```

## Topic Adaptation

Default: use any CSV and build a general data analyzer.

Bundled general sample: `data/sample_sales.csv`.

Recommended option 1: **Customer Feedback / Support Ticket Analyzer**

- Prioritize text columns such as `message`, `comment`, `ticket_text`, or `feedback`.
- Ask the LLM for themes, urgent issues, customer risks, and recommended actions.
- Bundled sample: `data/sample_customer_feedback.csv`.

Recommended option 2: **Product Review Insight Reporter**

- Prioritize text columns such as `review_text`, `title`, `pros`, or `cons`.
- Ask the LLM for positive themes, negative themes, feature requests, and product risks.
- Bundled sample: `data/sample_product_reviews.csv`.

These are theme adaptations, not separate assignments. Keep the same report contract.

## Target Output Schema

Your final `report.json` should preserve these top-level fields:

```json
{
  "metadata": {},
  "dataset_summary": {},
  "data_quality": {},
  "compression_summary": {},
  "llm_interpretation": {},
  "recommendations": [],
  "risk_notes": [],
  "errors_or_warnings": []
}
```

Map the validated LLM response into that schema consistently:

- `summary` and `insights` belong inside `llm_interpretation`.
- `recommendations` becomes the top-level `recommendations` list.
- `risk_notes` becomes the top-level `risk_notes` list.
- Any parse failures, repair attempts, or missing-data cautions belong in `errors_or_warnings`.

## Target Command

After completing the TODOs, your project should support a command like:

```bash
python analyze.py --input ../data/sample_sales.csv --out output
```

This is the target command, not a guarantee that the untouched template already works.

## Minimum Validation Checklist

- [ ] The project accepts a CSV path.
- [ ] The project does not send the full CSV to the LLM.
- [ ] The final run calls a real LLM.
- [ ] The prompt and raw/validated LLM response are saved.
- [ ] `output/report.json` exists and preserves the required top-level keys.
- [ ] `output/report.md` exists and is readable.
- [ ] README includes setup, API key/provider notes, and one-command run instructions.
- [ ] `prompts.md` or `ai_usage.md` explains AI Agent Coding Tool use.
- [ ] `postmortem.md` documents one real issue and fix.
